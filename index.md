Welcome to my (that is, Konrad Ja≈Çowiecki's) personal webpage.

![My ugly face](/assets/img/kj.jpg)

I'm a... 

- **Software enginner**, in love with Python programming language (but profficient in multiple 
  other languages as well).
- **Software architect**. Even more then writing code, I enjoy designing software solutions.
- **Scientific computing passionate**. The most interesting type of software is the one that
  backs up some science project. It is even more interesting when it involves quantum computing
  or parallel processing (e.g. using CUDA).
- **PhD candidate**, currently wrapping up my PhD thesis titled *Validation and benchmarking of 
  quantum annealing technology*.
- **Computer gamer**, although I suck at most multiplayer games I enjoy playing.

Probably the most important fact about me is my passion about the quality. I typically work slowly,
but precisely. So far this has worked wonders for me and all the projects I participated in. If you
think it can work for you too, check out my offer of consulting services and consider hiring me!
